# FedEx Flex - Employee and Manager Dashboard

STATUS: WORK IN PROGRESS

FedEx Flex is a web-based application designed to streamline flexible work management for FedEx. This project includes responsive dashboards for both employees and managers, facilitating efficient job opportunity posting, claiming, and management.

## Key Features:
- Employee Dashboard: Browse and claim available work opportunities, view claimed jobs, and receive real-time alerts.
- Manager Dashboard: Create, edit, and manage job opportunities, view claimed jobs, and access worker reports.
- Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices (mobile not fully implemented yet).
- Interactive UI: Dynamic job filtering, search functionality, and user-friendly interfaces.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

This project demonstrates modern web development practices, including responsive design, modular CSS, and interactive user interfaces. It serves as a prototype for a flexible workforce management system, showcasing potential features and user experiences for both employees and managers in a flexible work environment.

NOTES: This is a front-end demonstration and does not include backend functionality. It's intended to showcase UI/UX design and front-end development skills.

NOT FULLY FINISHED

For right now, the script.js and styles.css are directly related to the manager dashboard (indexManager.html) as they are linked in there. 
I have yet to work on most of the functionality and styling for the employee dashboard. (styles and functionality need to be updated for the employee dashboard)
(All of the HTML, JavaScript and CSS for the employee dashboard are in the same file (indexEmployee.html))


Need to work on mobile view for both dashboards as well.

Also, the index.html is the login page for both employee and manager dashboards.
